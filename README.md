Overview
The Synthetic Review Generator is a Python-based project that generates synthetic product reviews using a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) and filters for positive reviews using sentiment analysis. This tool can be useful for data augmentation, model training, and enhancing the diversity of review datasets.

Features
Generates synthetic positive reviews based on predefined prompts.
Filters existing reviews to extract only positive ones.
Saves generated and filtered reviews to a new CSV file for further analysis.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Git
An internet connection (for downloading the model)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Powwershell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AAKASHRESEARCH/synthetic-review-generator.git
cd synthetic-review-generator
Install Dependencies: Install the required packages using pip:

Powershell
Copy code
pip install pandas torch transformers
Usage
Prepare Your Dataset: Place your existing dataset of Amazon reviews in the same directory and name it synthetic_amazon_reviews.csv.

Generate Synthetic Reviews: Run the script to generate synthetic reviews:

Powershell
Copy code
python generate_reviews.py
Filter Positive Reviews: After generating reviews, run the sentiment analysis script to filter positive reviews:

PowerShell
Copy code
python filter_positive_reviews.py
Output: The generated synthetic reviews and filtered positive reviews will be saved in combined_amazon_reviews.csv and positive_amazon_reviews.csv, respectively.

Example Prompts
Here are some example prompts used to generate synthetic reviews:

"Write a positive review about a B Complex vitamin that improves absorption."
"Write a positive review about a vitamin that has all-natural sources."
